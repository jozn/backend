phone/email is per User not per Profile
====
+ todo: increase the range of tags number > pb can handle to few thousand numb n 2 bytes
+ Add message rich text > replace string with it
+ finer grade sepratin of rpc category (avatars, pins,..)
+ no ClearHistory for channel/group > just in chats
====
strive for make api solid
imple things not just for ui but full
====
migrate to new folder:
+ rpc modules to drop prefix (ex: Direct, Group,...) > we use local methods name > in gen out for those program that support moudles we use leverge it
    and in those that does not we use rpc_{moudleName} to build prefix for those ( like Golang) (UPDATE: READ BELOW)
+ there is only one global namespace for common data types (ex: User, Channel, Group, ...)

lessons:
+ we played with droping prfixes > things then will become messy fast in others Programing languuges that proplerly does not support moduling or with defautl protoc
     generator things tend to break or we should have many mouldes > it's not about our code generator, it's all about 3rd party defaluts > use prefix > verbose but simple and effective in all langs

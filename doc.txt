Notes:
    longblob in mysql has 8 bytes, text and blob has 4
    + uuid has a spec use the name only if you use that format
    + NOT:> we should ping server every 30-60 seconds >> update: NO , go for statless
    + favour statless connection
    + Phone number in international format always
    + Built the ecosystem around MySQL, no more in memory database > less moving parts
    + Build the system around a needed benchmark output > like 8k rpc processing per second
        this will make us to be design a better and more modular design and avoids trivial
        micro optimzation.
Policies:
    + Separation of concerns is more important than some code reuse. (ex: Media, Photo, Avatar, Thumb, Video,
      Audio,...) > give things space to grow independently and the scope/boundaries of their functionality be
       obvious and do not push many different types into one data type.
    + No Extremely low image thumb like telegram (telegram inline image is sub 200 bytes with removing
    header > this is overenginering for us as network and data is reletively cheap.
    telegram images is arond 700-800 bytes jpeg, going this way we are kind of writing in stone how
    our images should look likes. go for files for images and no embeded inline image. There will be a
    ton of problems with cashing, db sizes,... . > go with industry standards)
    + Telegram mime_type: "application/x-tgsticker" is telegram own stikers with ~7KB size. "thumb" is also is set.
    + Telegarm
    todo: skip from messages when they are spical document types: stickers,...
======
Probably limit the size of avatars to 640 (telegram is set 640)
======
todo: add MessageAction like telegram to pb > make room for it but not full impl yet
======
Note: ::prost::Message implements Debug attribute > ignore IDE error
todo: change RpcInvoke -> RpcEnumInvoke
======
Direct is DEPRECATED: as ui is now solidified we merge this rpc int each chat, channels and groups when
they are appropirate > it leads to more rpc and codes but it make things to easer to reason
about and let them evoulve independently
====

// todo: iterate over Direct as we have solidifed ui of chats, groups, channel > notifications,
// todo: research notfications in whatsApp > after near-launch
// todo: direct probebly should be deprecated as ui is slidified and functionaty diffrect considerblay > cosider add direct to chats,...
// todo: replace direct with Inbox (Chat, Group, Channel)

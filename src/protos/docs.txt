migrate to new folder:
+ rpc modules to drop prefix (ex: Direct, Group,...) > we use local methods name > in gen out for those program that support moudles we use leverge it
    and in those that does not we use rpc_{moudleName} to build prefix for those ( like Golang)
+ there is only one global namespace for common data types (ex: User, Channel, Group, ...)
